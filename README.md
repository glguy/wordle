# Console-based Wordle Implementation

This implementation can solve wordle puzzles or let you play wordle puzzles.

I'm not distributing a word list as I don't know that I have license to do so.
The game uses two word lists:

* `all.txt` for all the valid words
* `play.txt` for a list of words to randomly select from as the target word
